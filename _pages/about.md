Welcome to my website.

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Institute of Economics and Econometrics](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/institutes/iee/), [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/).

My research is broadly based on Applied Microeconomics- with a focus on Development Economics, Environmental and Resource Economics, Migration, and Political Economy.
